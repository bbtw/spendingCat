- Or press `Cmd+Shift+G` (Mac)

---

### 2. View Current Branch
- Look at the bottom-left corner of VS Code
- You'll see the current branch name (usually `main` or `master`)

---

### 3. Switch/Create Branch
- Click on the branch name in the bottom-left corner
- Select one of these options:
  - **"Create new branch..."** - to create a new feature branch
  - **"Switch to another branch..."** - to switch to an existing branch

---

### 4. Name Your Feature Branch
- If creating new: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/user-login`, `fix/navigation-bug`)
- If switching: Select the branch from the list

---

### 5. Start Coding
- You're now working on your feature branch
- Make your changes and commit them
- Push your branch when ready: `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ `Git: Push`

## You're Done!
The project is now cloned to your local machine and open in VS Code. You can start editing files, making commits, and pushing changes back to the repository.

## Troubleshooting
- **Authentication required**: VS Code may prompt you to sign in to GitHub
- **Permission denied**: Make sure you have access to the repository
- **Git not found**: Ensure Git is properly installed and in your system PATH
